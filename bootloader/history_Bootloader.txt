  - added fat32 support
  - added update of EEPROM
  - combined binary update-file

Version for sd2iec 1.x hardware:
 - Mega644
 - ID = 0x31434549; -> "IEC1"
 - checks CRC before flashing so bad or broken files are not accepted

Because of the additional CRC-check it won't fit into the bootloader-section
of a Mega32 anymore -> the size is 2164 bytes!

Updated some parts of the source-tree with new files from mikrocontroller.net.
FAT12 is now supported as well so even small cards should work.

Utilises the second LED (the red one) on the MMC2IEC as well.
While the green LED is blinking while a firmware update is in progress
the red LED stays lit as long as the bootloader is active.

Modified to accept a "0.0" binary as test-version and flash it regardless
of what version and revision the currently flashed binary has.

Installed in about 26 units of the second batch shipped.

The version that was released with V0.9 of MMC2IEC
and installed in about the first 11 units I shipped.

Initial effort, based on "HolgerBootloader10.zip" to be found on
www.mikrocontroller.net this is merely configured to work as
bootloader for MMC2IEC.

This first release was mostly experimental.
